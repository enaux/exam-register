<h1>Exam Student Register</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

This program allows the user to create a register of students for an exam venue.

It asks the user for:
<ul>
  <li>venue name</li>
  <li>number of registered students</li>
  <li>student ID numbers</li>
</ul>

<br>
A .txt file is created to register the students sitting their exam at the specified venue.

This file can then be used as an attendance sheet for the exam.

<h2>Installation:</h2>
Please ensure you have installed the latest version of Python.  
Download the student_register.py file from this repository.  
You should then be able to run the Python file directly or via your IDE.

<h2>Usage Instructions</h2>
TBA

<h2>Credits</h2>
The inspiration for this project was a practical task I completed as part of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/hyperion-development-south-africa/">HyperionDev</a>'s Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering (Fundamentals) Bootcamp.
